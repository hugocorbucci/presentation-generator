======================

The presentation generator hopes to help speaker build the basis for their talks.
It will receive bullet points, transform each of them in a slide, finds the top image for the keywords of that sentence and scales it to match the slide size. This basis will allow people to quick arrange a start for a presentation and improve over that.
